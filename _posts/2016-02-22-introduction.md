I have been doing freelance graphic design with Running Fox Designs for over a year now, and I would love to share some of my adventures here. I'll be uploading some behind the scenes content of what my design process looks like, the struggles of starting your own online business, and all the craziness that goes on around me.

I really hope that most of all you will see that I'm just a normal guy who loves to try to glorify God in all I do. I started this design business originally as an outlet for the meagre creative impulses I have. It has grown and evolved in ways that are beyond my description, but suffice it to say that God has blessed me and allowed me to bless others through this, and for that I am eternally grateful.
